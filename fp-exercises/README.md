# Problems

1. Reimplement range (and define it as range_), using generators

2. Implement segment_sum, which will sum numbers within a given range a to b

3. Implement square_sum, which will sum the squares of numbers within a given range a to b

4. Implement log_sum, which will sum the logarithms of numbers within a given range a to b

5. Is there a way to refactor 2-4?

6. Implement Newton-Raphson Square Roots

Suppose you have an initial estimate a0 for the square root of N. You can
improve a0 using the following rule: `a_next = (a0 + N/a0) / 2`. Square root of
N can then be calculated by improving the estimate until convergence.
